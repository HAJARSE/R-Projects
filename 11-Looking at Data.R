| Thanks, Hajar. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items before we begin our first lesson. First of all, you
| should know that when you see '...', that means you should press Enter when you are done reading and ready to
| continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to select from a list, that means it's your turn
| to enter a response, then press Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

Selection: 1

| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are already at the
| prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
| you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!

| Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is look at it! What is the format of the
| data? What are the dimensions? What are the variable names? How are the variables stored? Are there missing data? Are
| there any flaws in the data?

...

  |====                                                                                                           |   4%
| This lesson will teach you how to answer these questions and more using R's built-in functions. We'll be using a
| dataset constructed from the United States Department of Agriculture's PLANTS Database
| (http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html).

...

  |=========                                                                                                      |   8%
| I've stored the data for you in a variable called plants. Type ls() to list the variables in your workspace, among
| which should be plants.

> ls()
 [1] "cnames"     "datafile"   "datapath"   "ints"       "my_char"    "my_data"    "my_div"     "my_matrix"  "my_matrix2"
[10] "my_na"      "my_name"    "my_seq"     "my_sqrt"    "my_vector"  "num_vect"   "old.dir"    "patients"   "plants"
[19] "testdir"    "tf"         "urban"      "vect"       "vect2"      "x"          "y"          "z"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=============                                                                                                  |  12%
| Let's begin by checking the class of the plants variable with class(plants). This will give us a clue as to the
| overall structure of the data.

> class(plants)
[1] "data.frame"

| You got it right!

  |==================                                                                                             |  16%
| It's very common for data to be stored in a data frame. It is the default class for data read into R using functions
| like read.csv() and read.table(), which you'll learn about in another lesson.

...

  |======================                                                                                         |  20%
| Since the dataset is stored in a data frame, we know it is rectangular. In other words, it has two dimensions (rows
| and columns) and fits neatly into a table or spreadsheet. Use dim(plants) to see exactly how many rows and columns
| we're dealing with.

> dim(plants)
[1] 5166   10

| That's correct!

  |===========================                                                                                    |  24%
| The first number you see (5166) is the number of rows (observations) and the second number (10) is the number of
| columns (variables).

...

  |===============================                                                                                |  28%
| You can also use nrow(plants) to see only the number of rows. Try it out.

> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166

| All that practice is paying off!

  |====================================                                                                           |  32%
| ... And ncol(plants) to see only the number of columns.

> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

| That's correct!

  |========================================                                                                       |  36%
| If you are curious as to how much space the dataset is occupying in memory, you can use object.size(plants).

> object.size(plants)
745944 bytes

| You are quite good my friend!

  |============================================                                                                   |  40%
| Now that we have a sense of the shape and size of the dataset, let's get a feel for what's inside. names(plants) will
| return a character vector of column (i.e. variable) names. Give it a shot.

> names(plants)
 [1] "Scientific_Name"      "Duration"             "Active_Growth_Period" "Foliage_Color"        "pH_Min"
 [6] "pH_Max"               "Precip_Min"           "Precip_Max"           "Shade_Tolerance"      "Temp_Min_F"

| You got it right!

  |=================================================                                                              |  44%
| We've applied fairly descriptive variable names to this dataset, but that won't always be the case. A logical next
| step is to peek at the actual data. However, our dataset contains over 5000 observations (rows), so it's impractical
| to view the whole thing all at once.

...

  |=====================================================                                                          |  48%
| The head() function allows you to preview the top of the dataset. Give it a try with only one argument.

  |==========================================================                                                     |  52%
| Take a minute to look through and understand the output above. Each row is labeled with the observation number and
| each column with the variable name. Your screen is probably not wide enough to view all 10 columns side-by-side, in
| which case R displays as many columns as it can on each line before continuing on the next.

...

  |==============================================================                                                 |  56%
| By default, head() shows you the first six rows of the data. You can alter this behavior by passing as a second
| argument the number of rows you'd like to view. Use head() to preview the first 10 rows of plants.

| summary() provides different output for each variable, depending on its class. For numeric data such as Precip_Min,
| summary() displays the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum. These values help us understand
| how the data are distributed.

  |================================================================================                               |  72%
| For categorical variables (called 'factor' variables in R), summary() displays the number of times each value (or
| 'level') occurs in the data. For example, each value of Scientific_Name only appears once, since it is unique to a
| specific plant. In contrast, the summary for Duration (also a factor variable) tells us that our dataset contains 3031
| Perennial plants, 682 Annual plants, etc.

  |====================================================================================                           |  76%
| You can see that R truncated the summary for Active_Growth_Period by including a catch-all category called 'Other'.
| Since it is a categorical/factor variable, we can see how many times each value actually occurs in the data with
| table(plants$Active_Growth_Period).

| The beauty of str() is that it combines many of the features of the other functions you've already seen, all in a
| concise and readable format. At the very top, it tells us that the class of plants is 'data.frame' and that it has
| 5166 observations and 10 variables. It then gives us the name and class of each variable, as well as a preview of its
| contents.

| str() is actually a very general function that you can use on most objects in R. Any time you want to understand the
| structure of something (a dataset, function, etc.), str() is a good place to start.
